## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Loan Payment Reminder**
If a borrower misses a payment, the bot sends a polite reminder with options to reschedule or restructure the loan.

Example:
> "I noticed your EMI payment of ₹25,000 was due 30 days ago. Let’s explore flexible payment options together!"

### 2. **Payment Rescheduling**
When a borrower requests to defer their payment, the bot offers support by exploring available options like EMI adjustments.

Example:
> "I understand you’re facing difficulties. Could you share more about your situation so we can find the best solution?"

### 3. **Legal Notices**
For repeated missed payments, the bot issues a compassionate but firm notice, encouraging borrowers to settle dues before legal action.

Example:
> "We need to bring to your attention that there are 2 missed payments totaling ₹50,000. Please contact us within 7 days to discuss options."

### 4. **Financial Counseling**
The bot provides personalized advice on budgeting and debt management for borrowers struggling with repayment.

Example:
> "Based on your income of ₹50,000 and EMI of ₹15,000, here’s a recommended budget..."

## 🧪 Testing the Bot

You can test the bot with the following sample inputs:

| Input                                      | Expected Response                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "I can't pay my EMI this month"            | Offers rescheduling options and asks for more details.                           |
| "Stop calling me about my loan"            | Politely explains available options and avoids frustration.                      |
| "What happens if I miss payments?"         | Explains consequences and encourages setting up a repayment plan.                |
| "I want to apply for a personal loan"      | Redirects to the personal loans team or provides relevant links.                 |
